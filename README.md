Click on the Activate Cloud Shell button on top right and authorise the cloud shell.

4. Once done, click on Open Editor button to start editing in a proper IDE.
5. Let's set up a basic Express API endpoint by pasting in the following code in index.js:

Next, create a .env file with the following variable:

6. Next, update package.json by adding following scripts and also updating the type to module to support import statements.

Let's now run our app:

Your application will now be running on port 8080 and you can view it by clicking on the Web Preview button, which will take you to a new page that will say Hello World.

Your basic express API is now initialised and working!
